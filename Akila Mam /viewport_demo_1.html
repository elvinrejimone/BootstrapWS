       Responsive web design makes your web page look good on all devices.Responsive web design uses only HTML and CSS.Web pages can be viewed using many different devices: desktops, tablets, and phones. Your web page should look good, and be easy to use, regardless of the device.Web pages should not leave out information to fit smaller devices, but rather adapt its content to fit any device:Users are used to scroll websites vertically on both desktop and mobile devices - but not horizontally!. So, if the user is forced to scroll horizontally, or zoom out, to see the whole web page it results in a poor user experience.
